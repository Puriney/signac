# Signac

Signac is an extension of [Seurat](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat) for the analysis, interpretation, and exploration of single-cell chromatin datasets.

## Features

Signac is designed for the analysis of single-cell chromatin data, including scATAC-seq and single-cell targeted tagmentation methods such as scCUT&Tag and scACT-seq.

Signac currently supports the following features:

* Quantifying per-cell counts in different genomic regions
* Calculating single-cell QC metrics
* Dimensional reduction, visualization, and clustering
* Identifying cell-type-specific peaks
* Visualizing 'pseudo-bulk' coverage tracks
* Integration of multiple single-cell datasets
* Integration with single-cell RNA-seq datasets
* Sequence motif enrichment analysis
* Transcription factor footprinting analysis
* Parallelization through the [future](https://cran.r-project.org/package=future) package
* Seamless interface with [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat), [SeuratWrappers](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat-wrappers), [SeuratDisk](https://github.com/mojaveazure/seurat-disk), and [SeuratData](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat-data) functionality
* Interoperability with [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/) tools

Please see the Signac [vignettes](articles/overview.html) page for examples.

For installation instructions see the [install](articles/install.html) page.
